# ðŸ”· Tilesets

A tileset is the bread and butter of a Get Lost level. You create a tilemap by placing individual tile sprites that you sample from within a tileset.

Itch.io remains the current king for finding affordable and quality tilesets. Use [this link](https://itch.io/game-assets/tag-2d/tag-top-down) to browse some of the most popular ones. But, as with any online collection of assets, you can find real gems if you hunt.

Below are some tilesets I have personally purchased and can vouch for. I've listed the full price, but many assets are on sale at different times. Also, many of these assets have limited free versions.
