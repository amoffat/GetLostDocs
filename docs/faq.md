# ‚ùì FAQ

## Can my level be monetized?

Yes. Monetized levels get paid out through Stripe.

## Will there be multiplayer?

No. Get Lost is a single player experience and is not a good fit for multiplayer.

## Can you add web3/crypto/NFTs?

No. There is no place for crypto in Get Lost.

## Can I make a shooter/platformer/puzzler/etc in Get Lost?

The engine is flexible but opinionated. You can make levels with different mechanics, but the further you stray from telling stories, the more difficult it will be to make. The engine is really designed to tell stories, so if you go with that, you'll have the least amount of friction.

## Can I make a level with AI?

You can try, but I don't think you'll get very far. Making a level still requires you to have spatial and visual skills to lay out tiles and setup sensors. If you do manage to make a level with AI, there's a good chance it will be voted down by players due to it feeling inauthentic.
