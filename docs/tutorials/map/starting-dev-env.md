# ðŸ’» Starting development

Get Lost gives you a level template that you can (and should) use to start building levels quickly. It comes with a premade demo map, some sample level code, and public domain assets.

There are 3 ways to use the level template, from beginner to advanced:

- Using Github Codespaces
- Running it locally in a VSCode devcontainer
- Running it locally outside of a devcontainer

## Using Github Codespaces

!!! info "Difficulty: easy"

This is the recommeded way to use the Get Lost level template. You don't need anything installed on your computer... just a web browser and a Github account. Github Codespaces is a way to launch VSCode (and other programs) in the browser, so you can do all of your work in the browser without installing anything locally.

### Troubleshooting

#### The codespace takes forever to boot.

If you're not in US-East or US-West, this issue is likely caused by the prebuild cache not being available in your region. The codespace prebuild cache is something that I have to turn on manually per-region, and it accelerates the startup time, at a small cost to me. If you wait long enough, the codespace will boot. However, you can request your region be enabled in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/v4AAezkSEu).

## Local Devcontainer

!!! info "Difficulty: medium"

## Bare-metal installation

!!! info "Difficulty: medium"

This is the most advanced installation process because you need to manage the dependencies yourself. There aren't really too many advantages of this method over the local devcontainer.
