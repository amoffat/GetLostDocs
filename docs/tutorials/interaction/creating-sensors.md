# ðŸ“¡ Creating Sensors

Sensors are a key facilitator of interactions in a Get Lost level. When the player enters or exits a sensor, you can do things like trigger sounds, text dialogs, exit the level, or adjust some hidden state&mdash;whatever you can think of.

## Defining the sensor

In the Tiled app, make sure you have an Object Layer called `sensors`. This layer must contain only Tiled shapes (like rectangle or ellipse).
