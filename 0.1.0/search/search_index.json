The goal is to make it easy for creators to tell stories within a larger game experience. Creators make self-contained levels and then publish those levels into the Get Lost Universe (1). Players can then play those levels on their journey through the game.</p> <ol> <li>The Get Lost Universe is the total collection of all levels in Get Lost. Levels in the Universe are connected so that an exit of one level attaches to the entry of another level.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"about/#the-vision","title":"\u2728 The vision","text":"<p>The vision of Get Lost is to connect creative people in a new way, using a collaborative game, to create a unique experience that is impossible for any one of us to make on our own.</p>"},{"location":"about/#what-it-is","title":"\u2705 What it is","text":"<ul> <li>A premade framework for creating levels in a larger connected game</li> <li>A place for artists to tell stories and showcase their talent</li> <li>A place for artists to collaborate together to create a larger experience</li> <li>A dynamic story that grows and changes based on the contributions from individual levels</li> <li>An evolving universe with levels changing and appearing all the time</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/#what-it-is-not","title":"\u274c What it is not","text":"<ul> <li>A game-making framework</li> <li>A static game with set levels</li> <li>A pre-defined story or narrative</li> <li>A collection of separate mini-games</li> <li>A crypto or NFT project</li> <li>A place for AI slop</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/#the-pieces","title":"The pieces","text":""},{"location":"about/#the-engine","title":"\u2699\ufe0f The engine","text":"<p>The Get Lost engine provides all of the fundamental gameplay features like physics, sounds, controls, item inventory, tileset loading, etc... everything to make the level development and game experience run smoothly. As a creator, your interaction with the engine will be through the minimal code that you may choose to write for your level. For example, to play a sound, or to start a dialogue with an NPC. Other than that, the engine is mostly hidden from you.</p>"},{"location":"about/#the-platform","title":"\ud83e\udde9 The platform","text":"<p>The platform is what lets creators publish their level into the Get Lost Universe so that people on the internet can play it. Once a level has been published, it will be connected to the Get Lost game so that players can visit it as part of their journey. You, as a creator, can continue to tweak the content and evolve the level however you see fit, and your changes will be visible to the players in the game. As you think up new storylines, or create new items, you can add them to your level to enrich the player experience.</p>"},{"location":"about/#the-game","title":"\ud83c\udfae The game","text":"<p>The game is the player's cohesive experience through this universe of levels. Every level published by an artist is stitched into the universe by connecting it with other levels. And because all levels must have at least 1 entrypoint and at least 2 exits, there will always be more places to visit\u2014no dead ends.</p> <p>There is only one player avatar (1) that moves through levels, and players can make choices in levels that affect their traits. For example, if a player steals money from an NPC, the level may decrease their \"trustworthiness\" trait. Other levels can check this trait and give players different experiences.</p> <p>Items are another way for artists to collaborate across levels. Items that are picked up in one level can be used in other levels. For example, if a fire level gives a player a magic fire wand, and later they find themselves in an ice level, they might be able to melt a frozen door with it.</p> <ol> <li>One player avatar, but several possible variations. </li> </ol>"},{"location":"glossary/","title":"Glossary","text":""},{"location":"glossary/#a","title":"A","text":"<p>Animation Frame A single image in a sequence that forms an animation.
